# Bellt Button Bacteria Analysis
This project provides information regarding bacteria present in human belly button. The knowledge could potentially used to identify and design potential alternative sources of beef.
### Resources:
Software: javascript, html/css.
#### Data Sources: 
A large number of sample bacteria population was collected from volunteers. General dempgraphic including some relevant life style data was collected and alalused. The information could be accessed through the project dashboard. The information was coded under voluteer ids and no personally identifiable information is displayed.
The dashboard consists of four sections providing specific information each. The first section contains demographic information after corresponding to the user selected ID number from the dropdown menu. 
### Product Overview:
Following is a snapshot of the dashboard.

#### Section 1:
Demographic data corresponding to the selected ID.
#### Section 2:
Top ten (by level) bacteria present in the belly button of the test subject associated with the selected ID.
#### Secttion 3:
Gauge map for weekly frequency of scrubbing belly button which might influence the basteria colony present.
This includes an assumption of threshold washing frequency of 10 and the delta shows the subject frequency compared to the threshold.
#### Section 4:
Bubble chart for bacteria varieties and the size of the bubble proportional to the strength. The bubble also has hover text display.
